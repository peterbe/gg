A plugin for `gg <https://github.com/peterbe/gg>`_ for committing branches.


Installation
============

Doesn't need to be installed. It's part of ``gg`` by default.

How to develop
==============

To work on this, first run::

    pip install -U --editable .

That installs the package ``gg`` and its dependencies. It also
installs the executable ``gg``. So now you should be able to run::
